## What I know about GitHub
I have been using Git and GitHub for years now, while working in industry. They are both extremely useful tools for revision control. When I graduated college in 2015, I didn't have a good grasp of either tool. However, every company and project I've worked for since has used both, so I'd like to think I've gained some solid experience.
## What I don't know about GitHub
I still don't understand why they are called _pull_ requests. Shouldn't they be called _merge_ requests because you are requesting to merge your branch into another branch?
